<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>THE SONG
OF THE BOW</h2>
<p class="poetry">What of the bow?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bow was made in England:<br />
Of true wood, of yew-wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wood of English bows;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So men who are free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love the old yew-tree<br />
And the land where the yew-tree grows.</p>
<p class="poetry">What of the cord?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cord was made in England:<br />
A rough cord, a tough cord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A cord that bowmen love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>And so we will sing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the hempen string<br />
And the land where the cord was wove.</p>
<p class="poetry">What of the shaft?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shaft was cut in England:<br />
A long shaft, a strong shaft,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Barbed and trim and true;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we&rsquo;ll drink all
together<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the grey goose-feather<br />
And the land where the grey goose flew.</p>
<p class="poetry">What of the mark?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, seek it not in England,<br />
A bold mark, our old mark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is waiting over-sea.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the strings harp in
chorus,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the lion flag is o&rsquo;er
us,<br />
It is there that our mark will be.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>What of the men?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The men were bred in England:<br />
The bowmen&mdash;the yeomen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lads of dale and fell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s to you&mdash;and to
you!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the hearts that are true<br />
And the land where the true hearts dwell.</p>

4</span>CREMONA</h2>
<p>[The French Army, including a part of the Irish Brigade, under
Marshal Villeroy, held the fortified town of Cremona during the
winter of 1702.&nbsp; Prince Eug&egrave;ne, with the Imperial
Army, surprised it one morning, and, owing to the treachery of a
priest, occupied the whole city before the alarm was given.&nbsp;
Villeroy was captured, together with many of the French
garrison.&nbsp; The Irish, however, consisting of the regiments
of Dillon and of Burke, held a fort commanding the river gate,
and defended themselves all day, in spite of Prince
Eug&egrave;ne&rsquo;s efforts to win them over to his
cause.&nbsp; Eventually Eug&egrave;ne, being unable to take the
post, was compelled to withdraw from the city.]</p>
<p class="poetry">The Grenadiers of Austria are proper men and
tall;<br />
The Grenadiers of Austria have scaled the city wall;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They have marched from far away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere the dawning of the day,<br />
And the morning saw them masters of Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>There&rsquo;s not a man to whisper, there&rsquo;s not a
horse to neigh;<br />
Of the footmen of Lorraine and the riders of Dupr&eacute;s,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They have crept up every street,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the market-place they meet,<br />
They are holding every vantage in Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry">The Marshal Villeroy he has started from his
bed;<br />
The Marshal Villeroy has no wig upon his head;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have lost my men!&rsquo; quoth he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;And my men they have lost me,<br />
And I sorely fear we both have lost Cremona.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Prince Eug&egrave;ne of Austria is in the
market-place;<br />
Prince Eug&egrave;ne of Austria has smiles upon his face;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Says he, &lsquo;Our work is done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Citadel is won,<br />
And the black and yellow flag flies o&rsquo;er
Cremona.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Major Dan O&rsquo;Mahony is in the barrack
square,<br />
And just six hundred Irish lads are waiting for him there;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Says he, &lsquo;Come in your shirt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And you won&rsquo;t take any hurt,<br />
For the morning air is pleasant in Cremona.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Major Dan O&rsquo;Mahony is at the barrack gate,<br />
And just six hundred Irish lads will neither stay nor wait;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Dillon and there&rsquo;s Burke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there&rsquo;ll be some bloody work<br />
Ere the Kaiserlics shall boast they hold Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry">Major Dan O&rsquo;Mahony has reached the river
fort,<br />
And just six hundred Irish lads are joining in the sport;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, take a hand!&rsquo; says he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;And if you will stand by me,<br />
Then it&rsquo;s glory to the man who takes Cremona!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Prince Eug&egrave;ne of Austria has frowns upon
his face,<br />
And loud he calls his Galloper of Irish blood and race:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;MacDonnell, ride, I pray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To your countrymen, and say<br />
That only they are left in all Cremona!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">MacDonnell he has reined his mare beside the
river dyke,<br />
And he has tied the parley flag upon a sergeant&rsquo;s pike;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Six companies were there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Limerick and Clare,<br />
The last of all the guardians of Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Now, Major Dan O&rsquo;Mahony, give up
the river gate,<br />
Or, Major Dan O&rsquo;Mahony, you&rsquo;ll find it is too
late;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For when I gallop back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the signal for attack,<br />
And no quarter for the Irish in Cremona!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And Major Dan he laughed: &lsquo;Faith, if what
you say be true,<br />
And if they will not come until they hear again from you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there will be no attack,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For you&rsquo;re never going back,<br />
And we&rsquo;ll keep you snug and safely in Cremona.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>All the weary day the German stormers came,<br />
All the weary day they were faced by fire and flame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They have filled the ditch with dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the river&rsquo;s running red;<br />
But they cannot win the gateway of Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry">All the weary day, again, again, again,<br />
The horsemen of Dupr&eacute;s and the footmen of Lorraine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Taafe and Herberstein,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the riders of the Rhine;<br />
It&rsquo;s a mighty price they&rsquo;re paying for Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry">Time and time they came with the deep-mouthed
German roar,<br />
Time and time they broke like the wave upon the shore;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>For better men were there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Limerick and Clare,<br />
And who will take the gateway of Cremona?</p>
<p class="poetry">Prince Eug&egrave;ne has watched, and he gnaws
his nether lip;<br />
Prince Eug&egrave;ne has cursed as he saw his chances slip:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Call off!&nbsp; Call off!&rsquo; he cried,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is nearing eventide,<br />
And I fear our work is finished in Cremona.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Says Wauchop to McAulliffe, &lsquo;Their fire
is growing slack.&rsquo;<br />
Says Major Dan O&rsquo;Mahony, &lsquo;It is their last attack;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; But who will stop the game<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While there&rsquo;s light to play the same,<br />
And to walk a short way with them from Cremona?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>And so they snarl behind them, and beg them turn and
come,<br />
They have taken Neuberg&rsquo;s standard, they have taken
Diak&rsquo;s drum;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And along the winding Po,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beard on shoulder, stern and slow<br />
The Kaiserlics are riding from Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry">Just two hundred Irish lads are shouting on the
wall;<br />
Four hundred more are lying who can hear no slogan call;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the odds of that,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For it&rsquo;s all the same to Pat<br />
If he pays his debt in Dublin or Cremona.</p>
<p class="poetry">Says General de Vaudray, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
done a soldier&rsquo;s work!<br />
And every tongue in France shall talk of Dillon and of Burke!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Ask what you will this day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And be it what it may,<br />
It is granted to the heroes of Cremona.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo; says Dan
O&rsquo;Mahony, &lsquo;one favour we entreat,<br />
We were called a little early, and our toilet&rsquo;s not
complete.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve no quarrel with the shirt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the breeches wouldn&rsquo;t hurt,<br />
For the evening air is chilly in Cremona.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>THE
STORMING PARTY</h2>
<p class="poetry">Said Paul Leroy to Barrow,<br />
&lsquo;Though the breach is steep and narrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we only gain the summit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it&rsquo;s odds we hold the
fort.<br />
I have ten and you have twenty,<br />
And the thirty should be plenty,<br />
With Henderson and Henty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And McDermott in support.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Said Barrow to Leroy,<br />
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a solid job, my boy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For they&rsquo;ve flanked it, and they&rsquo;ve
banked it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve bored it with a
mine.<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>But
it&rsquo;s only fifty paces<br />
Ere we look them in the faces;<br />
And the men are in their places,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With their toes upon the line.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Said Paul Leroy to Barrow,<br />
&lsquo;See that first ray, like an arrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How it tinges all the fringes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the sullen drifting skies.<br
/>
They told me to begin it<br />
At five-thirty to the minute,<br />
And at thirty-one I&rsquo;m in it,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or my sub will get his rise.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;So we&rsquo;ll wait the signal
rocket,<br />
Till . . . Barrow, show that locket,<br />
That turquoise-studded locket,<br />
Which you slipped from out your pocket<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And are pressing with a kiss!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Turquoise-studded, spiral-twisted,<br />
It is hers!&nbsp; And I had missed it<br />
From her chain; and you have kissed it:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barrow, villain, what is
this?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Leroy, I had a warning,<br />
That my time has come this morning,<br />
So I speak with frankness, scorning<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To deny the thing that&rsquo;s true.<br />
Yes, it&rsquo;s Amy&rsquo;s, is the trinket,<br />
Little turquoise-studded trinket,<br />
Not her gift&mdash;oh, never think it!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For her thoughts were all for you.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;As we danced I gently drew it<br />
From her chain&mdash;she never knew it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I love her&mdash;yes, I love her:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am candid, I confess.<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>But I
never told her, never,<br />
For I knew &rsquo;twas vain endeavour,<br />
And she loved you&mdash;loved you ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would to God she loved you less!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Barrow, Barrow, you shall pay me!<br />
Me, your comrade, to betray me!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I know that little Amy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is as true as wife can be.<br />
She to give this love-badged locket!<br />
She had rather . . . Ha, the rocket!<br />

21</span>CORPORAL DICK&rsquo;S PROMOTION<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A BALLAD OF &rsquo;82</span></h2>
<p class="poetry">The Eastern day was well-nigh o&rsquo;er<br />
When, parched with thirst and travel sore,<br />
Two of McPherson&rsquo;s flanking corps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the Desert were tramping.<br />
They had wandered off from the beaten track<br />
And now were wearily harking back,<br />
Ever staring round for the signal jack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That marked their comrades camping.</p>
<p class="poetry">The one was Corporal Robert Dick,<br />
Bearded and burly, short and thick,<br />
Rough of speech and in temper quick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hard-faced old rapscallion.<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>The other,
fresh from the barrack square,<br />
Was a raw recruit, smooth-cheeked and fair<br />
Half grown, half drilled, with the weedy air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a draft from the home battalion.</p>
<p class="poetry">Weary and parched and hunger-torn,<br />
They had wandered on from early morn,<br />
And the young boy-soldier limped forlorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now stumbling and now falling.<br />
Around the orange sand-curves lay,<br />
Flecked with boulders, black or grey,<br />
Death-silent, save that far away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A kite was shrilly calling.</p>
<p class="poetry">A kite?&nbsp; Was <i>that</i> a kite?&nbsp; The
yell<br />
That shrilly rose and faintly fell?<br />
No kite&rsquo;s, and yet the kite knows well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-drawn wild halloo.<br />
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>And right
athwart the evening sky<br />
The yellow sand-spray spurtled high,<br />
And shrill and shriller swelled the cry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of &lsquo;Allah!&nbsp; Allahu!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Corporal peered at the crimson West,<br />
Hid his pipe in his khaki vest.<br />
Growled out an oath and onward pressed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still glancing over his shoulder.<br />
&lsquo;Bedouins, mate!&rsquo; he curtly said;<br />
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll find some work for steel and lead,<br />
And maybe sleep in a sandy bed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before we&rsquo;re one hour older.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;But just one flutter before we&rsquo;re
done.<br />
Stiffen your lip and stand, my son;<br />
We&rsquo;ll take this bloomin&rsquo; circus on:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ball-cartridge load!&nbsp; Now, steady!&rsquo;<br />
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>With a
curse and a prayer the two faced round,<br />
Dogged and grim they stood their ground,<br />
And their breech-blocks snapped with a crisp clean sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the rifles sprang to the &lsquo;ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas for the Emir Ali Khan!<br />
A hundred paces before his clan,<br />
That ebony steed of the prophet&rsquo;s breed<br />

A spurt of fire, a gasp of pain,<br />
A blueish blurr on the yellow plain,<br />
The chief was down, and his bridle rein<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was in the grip of the stranger.</p>
<p class="poetry">With the light of hope on his rugged face,<br
/>
The Corporal sprang to the dead man&rsquo;s place,<br />
One prick with the steel, one thrust with the heel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where was the man to outride him?<br />
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>A grip of
his knees, a toss of his rein,<br />
He was settling her down to her gallop again,<br />
When he stopped, for he heard just one faltering word<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the young recruit beside him.</p>
<p class="poetry">One faltering word from pal to pal,<br />
But it found the heart of the Corporal.<br />
He had sprung to the sand, he had lent him a hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Up, mate!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be &rsquo;ere
in a minute;<br />
Off with you!&nbsp; No palaver!&nbsp; Go!<br />
I&rsquo;ll bide be&rsquo;ind and run this show.<br />
Promotion has been cursed slow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is my chance to win it.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Into the saddle he thrust him quick,<br />
Spurred the black mare with a bayonet prick.<br />
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Watched
her gallop with plunge and with kick<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Away o&rsquo;er the desert careering.<br />
Then he turned with a softened face,<br />
And loosened the strap of his cartridge-case,<br />
While his thoughts flew back to the dear old place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the sunny Hampshire clearing.</p>
<p class="poetry">The young boy-private, glancing back,<br />
Saw the Bedouins&rsquo; wild attack,<br />
And heard the sharp Martini crack.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But as he gazed, already<br />
The fierce fanatic Arab band<br />
Was closing in on every hand,<br />
Until one tawny swirl of sand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Concealed them in its eddy.</p>

In the words he spoke, and that the day<br />

<p class="poetry">Ten mile in twenty minutes!&nbsp; &rsquo;E done
it, sir.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true.<br />
The big bay &rsquo;orse in the further stall&mdash;the one
wot&rsquo;s next to you.<br />
I&rsquo;ve seen some better &rsquo;orses; I&rsquo;ve seldom seen
a wuss,<br />
But &rsquo;e &rsquo;olds the bloomin&rsquo; record, an&rsquo;
that&rsquo;s good enough for us.</p>
<p class="poetry">We knew as it wa&rsquo;s in &rsquo;im.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s thoroughbred, three part,<br />
We bought &rsquo;im for to race &rsquo;im, but we found &rsquo;e
&rsquo;ad no &rsquo;eart;<br />
<a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>For
&rsquo;e was sad and thoughtful, and amazin&rsquo; dignified,<br
/>
It seemed a kind o&rsquo; liberty to drive &rsquo;im or to
ride;</p>
<p class="poetry">For &rsquo;e never seemed a-thinkin&rsquo; of
what &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad to do,<br />
But &rsquo;is thoughts was set on &rsquo;igher things,
admirin&rsquo; of the view.<br />
&rsquo;E looked a puffeck pictur, and a pictur &rsquo;e would
stay,<br />
&rsquo;E wouldn&rsquo;t even switch &rsquo;is tail to drive the
flies away.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet we knew &rsquo;twas in &rsquo;im, we
knew as &rsquo;e could fly;<br />
But what we couldn&rsquo;t git at was &rsquo;ow to make &rsquo;im
try.<br />
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>We&rsquo;d
almost turned the job up, until at last one day<br />
We got the last yard out of &rsquo;im in a most amazin&rsquo;
way.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was all along o&rsquo; master; which master
&rsquo;as the name<br />
Of a reg&rsquo;lar true blue sportman, an&rsquo; always acts the
same;<br />
But we all &rsquo;as weaker moments, which master &rsquo;e
&rsquo;ad one,<br />
An&rsquo; &rsquo;e went and bought a motor-car when motor-cars
begun.</p>
<p class="poetry">I seed it in the stable yard&mdash;it fairly
turned me sick&mdash;<br />
A greasy, wheezy engine as can neither buck nor kick.<br />
<a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>You&rsquo;ve a screw to drive it forrard, and a screw to
make it stop,<br />
For it was foaled in a smithy stove an&rsquo; bred in a
blacksmith shop.</p>
<p class="poetry">It didn&rsquo;t want no stable, it didn&rsquo;t
ask no groom,<br />
It didn&rsquo;t need no nothin&rsquo; but a bit o&rsquo;
standin&rsquo; room.<br />
Just fill it up with paraffin an&rsquo; it would go all day,<br
/>
Which the same should be agin the law if I could &rsquo;ave my
way.</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, master took &rsquo;is motor-car,
an&rsquo; moted &rsquo;ere an&rsquo; there,<br />
A frightenin&rsquo; the &rsquo;orses an&rsquo; a poisonin&rsquo;
the air.<br />
<a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>&rsquo;E
wore a bloomin&rsquo; yachtin&rsquo; cap, but Lor&rsquo;! wot
<i>did</i> &rsquo;e know,<br />
Excep&rsquo; that if you turn a screw the thing would stop or
go?</p>
<p class="poetry">An&rsquo; then one day it wouldn&rsquo;t
go.&nbsp; &rsquo;E screwed and screwed again,<br />
But somethin&rsquo; jammed, an&rsquo; there &rsquo;e stuck in the
mud of a country lane.<br />
It &rsquo;urt &rsquo;is pride most cruel, but what was &rsquo;e
to do?<br />
So at last &rsquo;e bade me fetch a &rsquo;orse to pull the motor
through.</p>
<p class="poetry">This was the &rsquo;orse we fetched &rsquo;im;
an&rsquo; when we reached the car,<br />
We braced &rsquo;im tight and proper to the middle of the bar,<br
/>
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>And
buckled up &rsquo;is traces and lashed them to each side,<br />
While &rsquo;e &rsquo;eld &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead so
&rsquo;aughtily, an&rsquo; looked most dignified.</p>
<p class="poetry">Not bad tempered, mind you, but kind of pained
and vexed,<br />
And &rsquo;e seemed to say, &lsquo;Well, bli&rsquo; me! wot
<i>will</i> they ask me next?<br />
I&rsquo;ve put up with some liberties, but this caps all by
far,<br />
To be assistant engine to a crocky motor-car!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Well, master &rsquo;e was in the car,
a-fiddlin&rsquo; with the gear,<br />
And the &rsquo;orse was meditatin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I was
standin&rsquo; near,<br />
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>When
master &rsquo;e touched somethin&rsquo;&mdash;what it was
we&rsquo;ll never know&mdash;<br />
But it sort o&rsquo; spurred the boiler up and made the engine
go.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&rsquo;Old &rsquo;ard, old gal!&rsquo;
says master, and &lsquo;Gently then!&rsquo; says I,<br />
But an engine won&rsquo;t &rsquo;eed coaxin&rsquo; an&rsquo; it
ain&rsquo;t no use to try;<br />
So first &rsquo;e pulled a lever, an&rsquo; then &rsquo;e turned
a screw,<br />
But the thing kept crawlin&rsquo; forrard spite of all that
&rsquo;e could do.</p>
<p class="poetry">And first it went quite slowly and the
&rsquo;orse went also slow,<br />
But &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad to buck up faster when the wheels began to
go;<br />
<a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>For the
car kept crowdin&rsquo; on &rsquo;im and buttin&rsquo; &rsquo;im
along,<br />
And in less than &rsquo;alf a minute, sir, that &rsquo;orse was
goin&rsquo; strong.</p>
<p class="poetry">At first &rsquo;e walked quite dignified,
an&rsquo; then &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad to trot,<br />
And then &rsquo;e tried a canter when the pace became too
&rsquo;ot.<br />
&rsquo;E looked &rsquo;is very &rsquo;aughtiest, as if &rsquo;e
didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;e mind,<br />
And all the time the motor-car was pushin&rsquo; &rsquo;im
be&rsquo;ind.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now, master lost &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead when
&rsquo;e found &rsquo;e couldn&rsquo;t stop,<br />
And &rsquo;e pulled a valve or somethin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
somethin&rsquo; else went pop,<br />
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>An&rsquo;
somethin&rsquo; else went fizzywiz, and in a flash, or less,<br
/>
That blessed car was goin&rsquo; like a limited express.</p>
<p class="poetry">Master &rsquo;eld the steerin&rsquo; gear,
an&rsquo; kept the road all right,<br />
And away they whizzed and clattered&mdash;my aunt! it was a
sight.<br />
&rsquo;E seemed the finest draught &rsquo;orse as ever lived by
far,<br />
For all the country Juggins thought &rsquo;twas &rsquo;im wot
pulled the car.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;E was stretchin&rsquo; like a
grey&rsquo;ound, &rsquo;e was goin&rsquo; all &rsquo;e knew;<br
/>
But it bumped an&rsquo; shoved be&rsquo;ind &rsquo;im, for all
that &rsquo;e could do;<br />
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>It butted
&rsquo;im an&rsquo; boosted &rsquo;im an&rsquo; spanked &rsquo;im
on a&rsquo;ead,<br />
Till &rsquo;e broke the ten-mile record, same as I already
said.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ten mile in twenty minutes!&nbsp; &rsquo;E done
it, sir.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true.<br />
The only time we ever found what that &rsquo;ere &rsquo;orse
could do.<br />
Some say it wasn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ardly fair, and the papers made a
fuss,<br />
But &rsquo;e broke the ten-mile record, and that&rsquo;s good
enough for us.</p>
<p class="poetry">You see that &rsquo;orse&rsquo;s tail,
sir?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; No more do we,<br />
Which really ain&rsquo;t surprisin&rsquo;, for &rsquo;e &rsquo;as
no tail to see;<br />
<a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>That
engine wore it off &rsquo;im before master made it stop,<br />
And all the road was littered like a bloomin&rsquo;
barber&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p class="poetry">And master?&nbsp; Well, it cured
&rsquo;im.&nbsp; &rsquo;E altered from that day,<br />
And come back to &rsquo;is &rsquo;orses in the good old-fashioned
way.<br />
And if you wants to git the sack, the quickest way by far<br />
Is to &rsquo;int as &rsquo;ow you think &rsquo;e ought to keep a
motor-car.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
